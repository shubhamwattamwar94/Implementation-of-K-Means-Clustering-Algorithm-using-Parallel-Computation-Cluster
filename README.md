# Implementation-of-K-Means-Clustering-Algorithm-using-Parallel-Computation-Cluster
â€œImplemented K-Means Clustering Algorithm using Parallel Computation  Cluster by openMP
first geneate data by running data-gen.cpp file the command are written in command file and then  run kmeans.pp.
Then you will see the time required for processing a data you can see report and pdf of openMP so you can increase the cluster size as well.
